I modified the code in the python script to search for all personnel benefits, listed under the Category column, that were greater than or equal to 100,000 in the year 2017. From the output of the csvstat command, it seems like 32 such rows fulfilled these conditions. Government contributions is the only program that matches or exceeds 100,000 for personnel benefits. The most common purpose was health insurance, accounting for around 18.5% of all such payments, and the median amount was approx. 1.7 million dollars.
